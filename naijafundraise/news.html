   <h4 class="green_t"> FLooding Outbreak in Nigeria</h4>
<p>We have experienced flooding on many levels in the past few years,
     but in recent months, many states have been hit by the worst case of flooding 
     we have seen. From Anambra to Kogi, Bayelsa, Benue, Rivers, Delta, Adamawa, Niger, 
     Katsina, Nasarawa, Jigawa, and many more states, floods are sweeping away homes, sabotaging 
     the economy, ruining properties and lives and leaving people displaced. Houses are being submerged, 
     farmlands are being destroyed, highways are collapsing and people are left stranded on the road. 
     Schools are being shut down, infrastructure is being destroyed and people are losing their lives 
     and means of livelihood daily. The poorest communities are the most hit by this disaster and are f
     urther plunged into poverty.

In September, the federal government, through Nigeria Hydrological Services
 Agency (NIHSA), sent a warning to 13 states susceptible to flooding. 
 Barely one month after, This Day has reported that 500 persons have now died, 
 45,249 houses have been totally destroyed and 70,566 hectares of farmlands have
  been damaged. VOA also reports that 1.4 million people have been displaced so far
   in the worst flooding Nigeria has experienced in a decade. This is a very big 
   deal!</p>

    <h6 class="green_t"> Abuja, Nigeria
        CNN
         — </h6>
        <p>Seventy-six people have died as their boat capsized while they tried to flee dangerously high floodwaters that have inundated swathes of southern Nigeria.
        The boat, carrying more than 80 people, capsized in the southeastern state of Anambra on Friday, as people desperately tried to escape floods that had risen as high as rooftops.
        Recent flooding in the area had displaced up to 600,000 people, according to the country’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
    </p>
        <p>Nigeria’s flood crisis has been disastrous this year, killing at least
             300 people and affecting more than half a million people, NEMA said 
             last month. NEMA warned of more catastrophic flooding for states 
             located along the courses of rivers Niger and Benue, explaining that t
             hree of Nigeria’s overfilled reservoirs were expected to overflow.
        The Anambra tragedy follows the devastating aftermath of a flood that 
        swept through swaths of neighboring north-central Kogi state a week ago, 
        leaving buildings submerged under water that rose to levels not seen in a 
        decade, according to officials of the Kogi Red Cross Society.
        
        At least six people, including a toddler, were reported to have died in Kogi’s 
        worst-hit Ibaji district, which the state Governor Yahaya Bello said was “100% 
        underwater.”</p>

            <p>Bello described the flooding as a “humanitarian tragedy” in an October 1 address.Kogi is located around 200 kilometers from Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Kogi’s capital, Lokoja, is 
                the meeting point for West Africa’s largest rivers, the Niger and Benue.
“As the two major rivers meet in Lokoja, they overwhelmed the banks of the
 Lower Niger river, hence the inundation,” environmentalist Simi Adeodun 
 told CNN.
                
                “Not only Lokoja is inundated right now, but most of 
                the riparian communities along the fringes of River Benue in
                 Nasarawa State … and River Niger traversing the boundary between
                  Kwara and Niger states are also submerged.” he said.</p>
                
                
                <p>“The roads served as a link between North Central and Southern parts of 
                    the country,” 
                    it said. “And many passengers were stranded.”
                The Red Cross told CNN some of the deceased in Ibaji also lost their
                 lives in a separate boat accident as they canoed through flood waters.
                Bello said that nine areas along the Niger and Benue were affected.
                “Ibaji [district] is almost 100% under water while the rest range 
                from 30% up … We therefore have a serious and humanitarian 
                tragedy on our hands, but I wish to assure every person, family 
                and community which has been affected that they are not alone and 
                that help is coming,”.</p>
